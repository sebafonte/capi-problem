This is an example of two problems i actually have on GUI:

	- When i run a process which executes some big calculation on background, interface lags and it´s inusable.
	
	- When timer executes (here i use a timer for the example but into an application redraw should be fired 
	with events) user multi-column-list-panel items might change its selection and could lead to errors when 
	selecting items.
